I maintain [my code on Github](https://github.com/jsocolar). A couple of exciting projects are on the horizon, including the phylosympatry R package (in development) and perhaps a new R package for fitting occupancy models via Stan (in planning).

Some of my best code, which runs unpublished analyses on public datasets, is currently in private repositories and therefore not visible at the link above.  Of course it will be made public when the papers come out!
