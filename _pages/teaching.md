Due to my extensive and irregular field schedule over the past 9 years, I have been well-equipped to support scientific education via public outreach activities and via collaborations with young researchers in the places I work. I'm very excited to return to teaching undergraduate and graduate classes in the near future. 

## Teaching
Most of what I know about nature I learned in the field or from a tome on natural history. But most of how I think about the natural world I learned from my physicist father. The natural sciences taught me to scaffold my knowledge of natural history in the context of larger frameworks—evolution, biogeography, Earth science, physics—that transform a tangled bank of facts and observations into a beautiful and coherent picture of how life on Earth operates. As a teacher, my goal is to introduce and cement this mode of thinking for students who grew up with neither binocular-strap tans nor dinner-table physics talk. 

Five principles summarize my overall approach: 
1. **Get outside** <img align="right" src="/images/bird-id-is-fun.jpg" width='310'/>
1. **Ask why**
1. **Be quantitative**
1. **Measure understanding**
1. **Be inclusive**

## Outreach

I love connecting people with science and nature (especially birds!). In addition to giving presentations at bird clubs and leading field outings (ranging from morning walks to multi-day tours), I am committed to helping birdwatchers engage in community science via monitoring programs including [Project eBird](https://ebird.org) and the [Audubon Christmas Bird Count](https://www.audubon.org/conservation/science/christmas-bird-count). My work for eBird, as a regional reviewer in Peru and Colombia, has involved making > 1000 contacts with observers (in both English and Spanish) to obtain details of noteworthy reports and to teach them to use eBird more effectively. I also organize and co-compile the [Christmas Bird Count in Durham, North Carolina](https://www.jeffpippen.com/birds/durhamcbc.htm).
