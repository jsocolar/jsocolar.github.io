Due to my extensive and irregular field schedule over the past 9 years, I have been well-equipped to support scientific education via public outreach activities and via collaborations with young researchers in the places I work. I'm very excited to return to teaching undergraduate and graduate classes in the near future. 

## Teaching

Most of what I know about nature I learned in the field or from a tome on natural history. But most of how I think about the natural world I learned from my physicist father. The natural sciences taught me to scaffold my knowledge of natural history in the context of larger frameworks—evolution, biogeography, Earth science, physics—that transform a tangled bank of facts and observations into a beautiful and coherent picture of how life on Earth operates. As a teacher, my goal is to introduce and cement this mode of thinking for students who grew up with neither binocular-strap tans nor dinner-table physics talk. Five principles summarize my overall approach.
### 1. Get outside 
I believe that the best way to spark interest in natural history and conservation is to put students in contact with nature, the best way to help students retain facts and data about the natural world is to let them see it for themselves, and the best way to foster deeper understanding in upper-level students with strong quantitative skills is to show them what data collection looks like. Outdoors, I have watched students find beauty on very their first walk in the woods, notice phenomena that I have overlooked, ask questions that I cannot answer, and collect empirical data to search for answers.
### 2. Ask why  
Scientific understanding transforms a fact to be memorized into a puzzle to reason about. For example, I would much rather that a student develop a rudimentary understanding of Hadley cells than memorize that temperate deserts tend to occur 30 degrees from the equator. Because “why” questions can form long chains, and their answers can introduce reams of new, head-cluttering facts, I make myself extensively available outside of class to pursue ‘why’ questions and build fuller scaffolds for interested students.
### 3. Be quantitative  
To teach natural history as a science requires engaging with ecology and behavior as quantitative disciplines. In upper-level courses, I teach students to be quantitative by asking them to perform quantitative analysis of data. For example, I helped a group of undergraduate students in Savannah Ecology to write their own scripts analyze a large-mammal survey data that they collected via distance sampling. But what about introductory courses? The ecology textbook on my shelf lacks a single mathematical problem set. At some institutions, majors might not engage in serious quantitative reasoning until they reach upper-level courses, and non-majors might satisfy distributional requirements with minimal exposure to the marriage of mathematics and empiricism that is fundamental to science since Newton. I address this issue using simple problem sets (e.g. Find the equilibrium species richness of an island given a source pool of 90 species, an annual colonization probability of .1 per species, and an annual extinction probability of .05 per species that lives on the island).
### 4. Measure understanding  
In my classroom, major assessments focus on measuring understanding via short-answer questions and quantitative problems (as appropriate). A short-answer question might begin with a fact and ask for the explanation, for example “In spring, many North American birds migrate north across the Gulf of Mexico and then continue north to their breeding grounds. Available evidence suggests that the timing of arrival on the breeding grounds varies much more from year to year than the timing of crossing the Gulf of Mexico. Why might we expect this to be the case?” 
### 5. Be inclusive 
Principles one, two, and three raise serious issues of equity and inclusion. 
1. Some students have much less experience, and much narrower comfort zones, in the outdoors than others. In field expeditions, birdwatching tours, and classroom outings, I begin with comfortable, “easy” field sites, and solicit explicit feedback from the group as I consider ramping up to more difficult sites. 
2. I am eager to delve deeper into why questions in office hours, which not all students can attend. I am explicitly flexible about accommodating students outside of regular office hours, and I remind students of this flexibility throughout the semester. 
3. At institutions that I know well, introductory biology courses tend to attract more diverse student populations than physics or chemistry, presumably in part because they require less quantitative preparation. Unlike in physics, for example, my goal in emphasizing quantitative problems is never to push the boundaries of students’ quantitative chops, but rather to foster understanding of how science uses math to understand the world. Therefore, the math is always, always conceptually simple and numerically easy.
