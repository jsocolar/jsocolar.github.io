Due to my extensive field schedule over the past decade, I have been well-equipped to support scientific education via public outreach activities and via collaborations with young researchers in the places I work. I'm excited to return to teaching undergraduate and graduate classes in the near future. 

## Teaching
Most of what I know about nature I learned in the field. But most of how I think about the natural world I learned from academia. The natural sciences taught me to scaffold my knowledge of natural history in the context of larger frameworks—evolution, biogeography, Earth science, physics—that transform a tangled bank of facts and observations into a beautiful and coherent picture of how life on Earth operates. As a teacher, my goal is to introduce and cement this mode of thinking. And to do so, my first priority is to spark interest in nature through inclusive pedagogy.

## Outreach

I love connecting people with science and nature (especially birds!). In addition to leading field trips and giving presentations for various organizations and clubs, I am committed to helping birdwatchers engage in community science via monitoring programs including [Project eBird](https://ebird.org) and the [Audubon Christmas Bird Count](https://www.audubon.org/conservation/science/christmas-bird-count). As an eBird reviewer for Peru and Colombia I have made thousands of contacts with observers to obtain details of noteworthy reports and to teach them to use eBird more effectively. I also organize and co-compile the [Christmas Bird Count in Durham, North Carolina](https://www.jeffpippen.com/birds/durhamcbc.htm).
