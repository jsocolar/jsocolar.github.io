Due to my extensive and irregular field schedule over the past 9 years, I have been well-equipped to support scientific education via public outreach activities and via collaborations with young researchers in the places I work. I'm very excited to return to teaching undergraduate and graduate classes in the near future. 

## Teaching
<p style="text-align:center;"><img src="images/bird-id-is-fun.jpg" alt="birdID" width="300"/>

Most of what I know about nature I learned in the field or from a tome on natural history. But most of how I think about the natural world I learned from my physicist father. The natural sciences taught me to scaffold my knowledge of natural history in the context of larger frameworks—evolution, biogeography, Earth science, physics—that transform a tangled bank of facts and observations into a beautiful and coherent picture of how life on Earth operates. As a teacher, my goal is to introduce and cement this mode of thinking for students who grew up with neither binocular-strap tans nor dinner-table physics talk. Five principles summarize my overall approach:
1. Get outside
2. Ask why
3. Be quantitative
4. Measure understanding
5. Be inclusive
