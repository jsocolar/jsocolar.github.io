I am an ecologist and conservation biologist with broad interests in species distributions, community dynamics, and avian biology. My postdoctoral work focuses on biodiversity change in the Colombian Andes ([Tor Haugaasen Lab](https://tropicalecology.wixsite.com/trecol), Norwegian University of Life Sciences & [David Edwards Lab](http://www.edwardslab.group.shef.ac.uk/)) and previously on the distributional ecology of North American birds in the context of global change ([Morgan Tingley Lab](www.morgantingley.com), University of Connecticut).
