I am a quantitative ecologist, ornithologist, and conservation biologist. Most of my work deals with species and community-level responses to global change at very large spatial scales. Large-scale patterns can illuminate some of the most pressing challenges of our times. For example, to understand how species might respond to climate change, I study and compare demographic responses to temperature fluctuations across species' entire ranges. To inform progress towards global conservation targets I study biodiversity responses to land-use change over large areas--and these can differ substantially from average local-scale impacts! Gaining inferential traction on large-scale patterns and processes requires the tools to collect and analyze high-quality, taxonomically resolved data over vast areas. I combine cutting-edge statistics and high-performance computing, newly available "big data" from community-science monitoring, and massive old-school field campaigns to crack some of the trickiest--but most rewarding--problems in applied ecology today.

When I'm not hard at work, I like being with my family and exploring outdoors for interesting birds and other critters. As my daughter grows up, these pursuits are increasingly compatible.
