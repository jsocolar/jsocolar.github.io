I am an ecologist and conservation biologist with broad interests in species distributions, community dynamics, and avian biology. I work on biodiversity change in the Colombian Andes,  distributional ecology of North American birds in the context of global change, and biodiversity and community structure in Amazonia. 

I also have theoretical and empirical interests in species coexistence, community dynamics, and the challenges associated with applying modern statistical practice (complex models) to modern datasets (big data). I especially value my intuition as a naturalist as I venture into these more abstract territories.

When I'm not hard at work, I like being with my family and exploring outdoors for interesting birds and other critters. As my daughter grows up, these pursuits are increasingly compatible.
