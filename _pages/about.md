I am a quantitative ecologist, ornithologist, and conservation biologist. Most of my work deals with how species and communities respond to global change across very large spatial scales. At these large scales, spatial variation in global-change impacts illuminates process and mechanism. For example, to understand species' responses to climate change, I examine and compare demographic responses to temperature fluctuations across species' entire geographic ranges. At the same time, the spatial scaling of global-change impacts sometimes leads to surprising large-scale outcomes. To inform progress towards global conservation targets, I study the spatial scaling of biodiversity responses to land-use change over large areas (large-scale impacts can differ massively from the average local-scale impacts!). 

Grappling with these large-scale questions requires innovative approaches to collect and analyze high-quality, taxonomically resolved data over vast areas. I combine cutting-edge statistics and high-performance computing, newly available big data from community-science monitoring, and massive old-school field campaigns to crack some of the trickiest--but most rewarding--problems in applied ecology today.

When I'm not hard at work, I like being with my family and exploring outdoors for interesting birds and other critters. As my daughter grows up, these pursuits are increasingly compatible.
