I am an ecologist and conservation biologist with broad interests in species distributions, community dynamics, and avian biology. My postdoctoral work focuses on biodiversity change in the Colombian Andes ([Tor Haugaasen Lab](https://tropicalecology.wixsite.com/trecol), Norwegian University of Life Sciences & [David Edwards Lab](http://www.edwardslab.group.shef.ac.uk/), Sheffield University) and previously on the distributional ecology of North American birds in the context of global change ([Morgan Tingley Lab](www.morgantingley.com), University of Connecticut). My PhD research ([David Wilcove Lab](https://scholar.princeton.edu/dwilcove/home), Princeton University) focused on biodiversity loss and determinants of avian community structure in Peruvian Amazonia, home to the richest bird assemblages on Earth.

I also have theoretical and empirical interests in species coexistence, community dynamics, and the challenges associated with applying modern statistical practice (complex models) to modern datasets (big data). I especially value my intuition as a naturalist as I venture into these more abstract territories.

When I'm not hard at work, I like being with my family and exploring outdoors for interesting birds and other critters. Happily, as my daughter grows up, these pursuits are increasingly compatible.
