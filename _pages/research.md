Most of my work deals with big questionsâ€”not just important, but actually physically big. My core interests include the spatial scaling of biodiversity loss, range-wide responses of species to climate change, and the biogeographic predictability of how biodiversity responds to anthropogenic pressures. Traction on these questions has been limited by the twin difficulties of obtaining and analyzing detailed ecological data across large spatial extents. Using a combination of extensive fieldwork, community science, and modern statistical practice, my research seeks to push the envelope by going big.

## Agriculture & tropical biodiversity

## Climate change & North American birds

Across much of the temperate zone, bird migration and nesting is happening earlier in spring. I am interested in how phenological shifts influence the temperatures that a species experiences during critical life-history events, and whether phenology plays a role in thermal niche tracking at the scale of species' entire ranges. I am also interested in continental-scale patterns and controls on the timing of spring bird migration. I address these questions using large-scale community science data on bird occurrence (eBird), breeding abundance (Breeding Bird Survey), and nest success (Project Nestwatch), supplemented with historical re-survey data from the [Grinnell Resurvey Project](http://mvz.berkeley.edu/Grinnell/) and weather and green-up data from USGS and NASA.
